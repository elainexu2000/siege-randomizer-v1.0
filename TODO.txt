###TODO:

Easy to do but not sure if useful: 
	- Download every weapon's img from ubisoft website; sort by weapon type
	- Same thing for scope, barrel, grip, laser, op icon


Project design:
1. Learn how to fetch backend data with Jinja2 {{}}
2. What do you want your page to look like?
	- Info/image to be displayed?
	- Page design
3. Deployment: is github page enough?
4. What additional features to support?
	- TRANSLATION: yeah why do my friends speak so many different languages??
		- but not THAT many languages -- additional attributes viable?
	- Map selection + random spawn location
		- How to store that information for the session?
	- User-input random tactics


Program logics:
1. Exception handling:
	- Should add_gadget throw exception when sides don't match?
		(i.e. trying to add c4 to an attacker) 
		user shouldn't be able to interact with this <- prob not
2. Should i take object-oriented to the extreme and make separate classes for scope/barrel/laser/grip?
	- So that a Weapon HAS A scope, HAS a barrel,..., and a Scope HAS an attribute (path to image)...


Minor stuff:
1. Font: which font to use? (preferably matching siege's)
	- License issue
	- Include as a resource
2. Asset fine tuning:
	- No HUD icon image for 'hard breach charge' and 'impact emp grenade'
		a) Use a different style (in-game screen capture?) OR 
		b) draw my own?? <-- how?
	- Make transparent background for barrel images
3. Accuracy:
	- Double check: weapons incompatible with laser?
		DMR: OTs-03, CSRX 300
		LMG: G8A1
		MP: C75
		Handgun: GSH-18
	- Double check: OTs-03 doesn't have reflex C??
